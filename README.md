# 📊 Advertising Sales Prediction with Polynomial Regression

This mini-project explores the effect of advertising budgets on sales using Linear Regression models. The dataset includes spending data across three channels: TV, radio, and newspaper.

## 🔍 Objective

To improve prediction accuracy by introducing Polynomial Features (degree=2) and comparing the model performance before and after.

## 📈 Results

- **Linear Regression** → R² ≈ 0.899  
- **Polynomial Regression (degree=2)** → R² ≈ 0.980  

🎯 Significant improvement after introducing interaction and squared terms!

## 🧠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files

- `advertising_model_before_after_poly.py` → Full code: before and after applying PolynomialFeatures

## 📷 Visualization

Residuals and predicted vs. actual plots were used to assess model accuracy.
